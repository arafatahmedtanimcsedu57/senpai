# Agentic Development Pipeline

An end-to-end, spec-driven, self-correcting pipeline for building **any** React
(Vite + TypeScript) app with Claude Code, with preview deploys per PR (e.g. Vercel). It combines a human-owned
planning workflow with automated execution and enforcement. Drop the accompanying `.claude/`
folder and `CLAUDE.md` into any React repo to use it.

## The one principle everything rests on

Automation does not remove the human gate — it **relocates it to the pull request**.
Everything upstream of the PR can be automated aggressively, because nothing reaches `main`
(or production) until CI is green _and_ a human approves the PR.

## The flow at a glance

```
DEFINE            plan mode → features.md
                  decide tech + design tokens → architecture.md
DESIGN            Claude Design: theme (/start) + a page per feature (/feature)
                  you edit the design yourself on claude.ai
SPEC              OpenSpec propose → proposal / spec / tasks.md   (/feature)
   ★ GATE 1       /build: you approve design + tasks.md (cheapest place to fix intent)
IMPLEMENT LOOP    /build → copy design into design/ → implement
                  later design edits → /sync-ui → code catches up
   ↻ self-correct   after each edit: prettier + eslint + typecheck (errors fed back)
                     at turn end: related tests + react-doctor (errors fed back)
                     npm run check + e2e (axe) + screenshots vs design at the done-gate
VERIFY            CI: typecheck · lint · format · unit · e2e · react-doctor (changed)
SHIP              Vercel preview deploy per PR
   ★ GATE 2       you review the PR + preview URL
                  merge → prod deploy → /finish → living specs
```

Ownership: **you drive** DEFINE and both gates; **the agent runs** DESIGN, SPEC, IMPLEMENT;
**the machine enforces** VERIFY. See "Human involvement" below for what that costs you.

## Phase 0 — One-time setup (per repo)

This starter already has OpenSpec initialised, the MSW worker committed, and every tool
pinned in `package.json`. Create your repo with "Use this template", then run `/start` in
`claude`: it names the project, confirms styling + UI library, removes the example and
drafts the first `features.md` / `architecture.md`. What's left is the human-only setup on
GitHub:

```bash
npm ci && npx playwright install chromium
# From inside `claude` in the repo:  /install-github-app   (adds ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
```

1. **Branch protection** on the default branch: require `CI` + `PR size` checks, 1 review,
   and "Require review from Code Owners". Edit `.github/CODEOWNERS` with real people.
2. **Preview deploys** (Vercel, Netlify, …) so Gate 2 can include a click-through.
3. **Autopilot** stays off until you set the repo variable `AUTOPILOT_ENABLED=true`.

---

## Phase 1 — Define (you drive)

1. In **plan mode**, talk through the feature. No code yet.
2. Capture user-facing behaviour, states, and edge cases in `features.md`.
3. Record tech decisions, design tokens, and the styling approach + UI library in
   `architecture.md`.
4. **Establish the API contract** before the data layer or UI. Three cases (details in
   `CLAUDE.md`): an OpenAPI/Swagger spec exists → generate the RTK Query layer (or hand-write
   if messy); an informal contract → capture it as Zod schemas; frontend-first with no API yet
   → write the contract first and mock it with MSW so the UI never blocks on the backend.

Keep `features.md` / `architecture.md` as the _human inputs to OpenSpec_ — don't hand-maintain
a parallel spec.

## Phase 2 — Design (agent runs)

The UI lives in **Claude Design** (claude.ai): a Design System for the theme and one canvas
with a page per feature, one screen per state. `/start` creates both; `/feature` reuses a
feature's page or designs a new one in the same theme. You edit the design directly; `/build`
re-reads it, and `/sync-ui` brings built code in line with later edits. Details:
`.claude/skills/feature-pipeline/claude-design.md`.

## Phase 3 — Spec + Gate 1 (agent runs → you review)

1. Run OpenSpec **propose** → `proposal.md`, delta specs, `design.md`, `tasks.md`.
2. **★ GATE 1 — answer the brief before implementing.** The agent sends risk tier, size and
   the open decisions with its defaults; your explicit approval becomes the
   `approved: <name>, <date>` line in `tasks.md`. Cheapest place to fix intent — and
   the place to control PR size. One change = one PR, max 400 reviewable lines; anything
   bigger gets split into several changes here (e.g. contract → UI → wiring).

## Phase 4 — Implement loop (agent runs, self-correcting)

1. `/clear` (implement against the spec file, not a bloated transcript).
2. Run OpenSpec **apply**. Work down `tasks.md`, placing files per the folder structure.
3. Self-correction on each edit: hooks run prettier + typecheck; react-doctor's agent-hook
   feeds findings back. Write tests as you go.

**Definition of done** (in `CLAUDE.md`, run before any task is finished):

```
npm run check
```

## Phase 5 — Verify + Ship + Gate 2

1. Agent opens a PR (manually, via `@claude`, or via autopilot).
2. **CI gate** runs: typecheck, lint, unit + component tests, e2e, `react-doctor --scope changed`, `format:check`,
   plus the **PR size check** (`pr-size.yml`, 400 reviewable lines; the `large-pr-approved`
   label bypasses it). The PR body follows `.github/pull_request_template.md` so the reviewer
   knows what to read closely and what to skim.
3. Your preview host (e.g. Vercel) posts a **preview URL** — eyeball it (closes the visual gap).
4. **★ GATE 2 — review the PR + preview**, then merge.
5. Run OpenSpec **archive** to fold the change into living specs.

---

## The two automation layers

**Enforcement (CI/CD)** — `ci.yml` is the machine that catches mistakes; it must exist before
anything autonomous writes code. Nothing merges red.

**Execution (autonomous agent)** — `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` turns work into PRs:

- **On-demand:** mention `@claude` on an issue → it branches, implements, tests, opens a PR.
- **Scheduled:** off by default. When enabled, a weekday-night job picks the next
  **approved** `openspec/changes/` folder and opens a PR. It won't guess: unanswered open
  questions, a needed dependency, or an oversized change become a GitHub issue for a human.
- **Own hardware:** point the job at a self-hosted runner instead of `ubuntu-latest` to run on
  your own machine.

Every autonomous PR still lands at Gate 2.

## Human involvement — what it actually looks like

The gates only work if they fit into a real person's day. The rules that make that true:

- **Ask for decisions, not reading.** Gate 1 is a one-screen brief: risk tier, size, and
  the open questions with the agent's default for each. Most approvals are "yes" or
  "yes, except 2". The full `tasks.md` is there if you want it.
- **Attention scales with risk.** Every proposal carries a tier (low / medium / high, see
  `CLAUDE.md`). Low-risk work can skip Gate 1 if you say so; high-risk work gets a second
  reviewer. Reviewing a copy change like a schema change burns people out.
- **Approval is a fact, not a vibe.** `tasks.md` ends with `approved: <pending>`. Only a
  human's explicit "approve" (in chat, or in a spec-PR review) turns it into
  `approved: <name>, <date>`. `/feature` and autopilot refuse to implement unapproved changes.
- **Async by default for teams.** If the approver isn't in the session, open a spec-only
  PR; CODEOWNERS routes it. Merged spec = approved spec.
- **Surfaced judgement calls.** Agent PRs list "Decisions I made without asking", so the
  reviewer confirms choices instead of hunting for them in the diff.
- **Hard stops are enforced by tools, not prose.** Merging, force-pushing and pushing to
  the default branch are denied in `.claude/settings.json`; installs, pushes and edits to
  CI / `CLAUDE.md` ask first; branch protection is the backstop.
- **The agent escalates instead of looping.** Three failed attempts at the same check →
  it stops and explains. It never disables a test or rule to get green.
- **Corrections compound.** When a reviewer corrects the same thing twice, the agent
  proposes a one-line `CLAUDE.md` rule, and the human decides whether to add it.

A realistic week for one reviewer: ~5 min per Gate 1 brief, ~10–20 min per Gate 2 PR
(preview click-through + the "Review carefully" lines), and a glance at autopilot's
"Question:" / "Split needed:" issues each morning.

---

## Guardrails

- **Branch protection is non-negotiable.** Require the CI check + 1 review on `main`.
- **Context hygiene.** `/clear` before implementation.
- **react-doctor scores are heuristic** — treat a drop as "look here," not "auto-block."
  Real tests verify behaviour; react-doctor verifies smell. (Dead-code detection was dropped
  in v0.2 — run `npx knip` separately if you want it.)
- **Cost.** The agent consumes API tokens + Actions minutes; workflows cap `--max-turns` and
  `timeout-minutes`. `--scope changed` keeps react-doctor from failing on legacy issues.
- **Fork security.** On fork PRs the default `pull_request` event can't read
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (safe). Never use `pull_request_target` with untrusted fork code.

---

## Daily loop (the TL;DR)

1. `/feature <idea>` → requirements, design (reused or new), spec.
2. Edit the design on claude.ai until it looks right.
3. `/build <change>` → answer the Gate 1 brief → agent implements; hooks + react-doctor +
   tests + screenshots self-correct.
4. PR opens → CI runs → preview deploy appears.
5. **Review PR + preview** (Gate 2) → merge → `/finish <change>`.
6. Changed a built screen's design later? `/sync-ui`.
7. Bug in something already shipped? `/fix <bug>` → failing test → fix → PR (Gate 2 only).

Two gates, everything else automated.
