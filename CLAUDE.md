# Project conventions — senpai

Authoritative rules for this repo. Claude reads this every session — follow it over habit.
(Project name, and the styling approach + UI library, are set during bootstrap.)

## Commands

- Dev: npm run dev
- Build: npm run build
- Typecheck: npm run typecheck
- Lint: npm run lint
- Test: npm run test
- E2E: npm run test:e2e
- Doctor: npm run doctor
- Format: npm run format
- Coverage: npm run test:coverage
- All gates (definition of done): npm run check

Hooks already run prettier + eslint + typecheck after every edit, and related tests +
react-doctor before you finish a turn. Their errors come back to you — fix them, don't
work around them.

## Slash commands (the human's only interface)

The human uses exactly six: `/start` (once: set up the project + its Claude Design),
`/feature <idea>` (design + spec, then stop so they can edit the design), `/build
<change-name>` (Gate 1 → code → PR), `/sync-ui [feature]` (code catches up with design
edits), `/finish <change-name>` (after merge: archive the spec), `/fix <bug>` (a bug in
shipped behaviour: failing test → fix → PR, no design or spec step). Every other skill (`feature-pipeline`, `openspec-*`) is internal —
you invoke it; never tell the human to run it. When a vendored OpenSpec skill says "run
`/opsx:propose`", say `/feature`; for `/opsx:apply`, say `/build <change-name>`; for `/opsx:archive` or
`/opsx:sync`, say `/finish <change-name>`.

## UI design (Claude Design)

- Claude Design on claude.ai is the source of truth for the UI; links in `architecture.md`
  → Design. Rules: `.claude/skills/feature-pipeline/claude-design.md`.
- `design/` is the copy of the design as last built. Only `/build` and `/sync-ui` write it;
  never hand-edit it.
- Colours, fonts and radii come from design tokens, never hex values copied into components.

## Human in the loop

A person owns intent, decisions and merges. You own execution. Act, but know when to stop.

**Stop and ask — never guess — when:**

- the spec / `features.md` doesn't settle a product or UX behaviour (copy, empty/error
  states, what happens on edge cases)
- a change touches the API contract (a Zod schema, an endpoint, a response shape)
- you want a new dependency, or to change `architecture.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, CI or hooks
- you'd delete or rewrite code outside the change's scope
- the same check fails 3 times and you don't know why

Ask one concrete question with your recommended answer, so the human can reply "yes".

**Risk tiers** (set in every `proposal.md`; decides how much human attention it needs):

| Tier   | Examples                                          | Human involvement                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| low    | copy, styling, a test, a small isolated component | Gate 2 only; skim is fine                  |
| medium | new feature UI, state logic, a new dependency     | Gate 1 + Gate 2 with preview click-through |
| high   | contract/schema, auth, money, data deletion, CI   | Gate 1 + Gate 2 + a second reviewer        |

**Gates:**

- Gate 1 — the human approves `tasks.md`. Approval is only real when **they** say so; you
  then write `approved: <their name>, <date>` as the last line of `tasks.md`. Never write
  it on your own initiative. Autopilot only builds changes that carry this line.
- Gate 2 — the human reviews the PR + preview and merges. You never merge or push to the
  default branch (both are blocked in `.claude/settings.json`).
- While waiting at a gate, don't start the next step. Say what you're waiting for and what
  the human needs to decide, in one or two lines.

**Learn from corrections:** if a human corrects the same kind of thing twice, propose a
one-line rule for this file. Don't add it until they agree.

## Component conventions

- Function components only; named exports (no default exports)
- One component per file; colocate `<Component>.test.tsx`
- Props typed with an explicit `<Component>Props` interface
- Data fetching lives in hooks, never inline in components
- Styling + UI library: as recorded in `architecture.md`
- Place every file according to **Folder structure** below

## Folder structure

Fixed layout. Put new files where they belong — do not invent new top-level folders or
rename these.

```

```

Placement rules:

- Pure function → `src/lib/`. Shared hook → `src/hooks/`. Shared type → `src/types/`.
- Anything specific to one domain → `src/features/<domain>/` (its components, endpoints,
  Zustand store, Zod schema, and types live together).
- RTK Query base slice → `src/services/api.ts`; feature endpoints inject into it from
  `src/features/<domain>/api.ts`.
- Reusable UI → `src/components/` (`components/ui/` for primitives); pages → `src/routes/`.
- Tests are colocated next to the file they test; only Playwright specs live in `e2e/`.
- New page → `src/routes/<Name>Page.tsx` + one entry in `src/routes/routes.tsx` (lazy-loaded).
- New env variable → `src/lib/env.ts` (Zod) + `src/vite-env.d.ts` + `.env.example`. Never
  read `import.meta.env` anywhere else.
- Import direction is enforced by ESLint: `lib/` + `types/` import no app layer;
  `components/`, `hooks/`, `stores/`, `services/` never import `features/` or `routes/`;
  `features/` never imports `routes/`. A feature doesn't reach into another feature's
  `components/` — move shared pieces up to `src/components/` or `src/lib/`.
- Small apps may start with just the top-level folders and add `features/<domain>/` as they
  grow — keep these names; never add a parallel folder that does the same job.

## State, data fetching & forms (fixed rules)

Three libraries, three jobs — do not mix them up:

| Concern                      | Library                   | Never use instead                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Server state / data fetching | **RTK Query**             | raw `fetch`/`axios` in components |
| Client / UI state            | **Zustand**               | Redux slices for UI state         |
| Forms + validation           | **React Hook Form + Zod** | uncontrolled ad-hoc validation    |

### Server state + data fetching — RTK Query

- All server data goes through RTK Query (from `@reduxjs/toolkit`). No raw `fetch`/`axios`
  in components or hooks.
- Define endpoints in an api slice; use `tagTypes` for cache invalidation; components
  consume the generated hooks (`useGetXQuery`, `useAddXMutation`).
- Redux Toolkit exists in this project **only** as the RTK Query API layer.
- If an OpenAPI/Swagger spec exists, prefer generating this layer — see **API contracts &
  mocking** below. The hand-written form below is for when there's no clean spec.

```ts
// src/services/api.ts — the ONE slice, no endpoints. baseQuery adds the base URL from env,
// the Bearer token from useSessionStore, and signs out on 401. Never create a second slice.
export const api = createApi({ reducerPath: 'api', baseQuery, endpoints: () => ({}) })

// src/features/items/api.ts — the feature owns its endpoints + tags
export const itemsApi = api.enhanceEndpoints({ addTagTypes: ['Item'] }).injectEndpoints({
  endpoints: (build) => ({
    getItems: build.query<Item[], void>({ query: () => 'items', providesTags: ['Item'] }),
    addItem: build.mutation<Item, NewItem>({
      query: (body) => ({ url: 'items', method: 'POST', body }),
      invalidatesTags: ['Item'],
    }),
  }),
})
export const { useGetItemsQuery, useAddItemMutation } = itemsApi
```

`src/store.ts` exports `makeStore()` (fresh store per test via `src/test/render.tsx`) and the
app's `store`, which `main.tsx` passes to `<Provider>`.

### Client / UI state — Zustand

- Local and cross-component client state (UI toggles, filters, wizard steps, selected rows)
  lives in Zustand stores — not Redux.
- One store per concern; keep stores small; **select narrowly** to avoid re-renders.

```ts
// src/stores/useUiStore.ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

interface UiState {
  sidebarOpen: boolean
  toggleSidebar: () => void
}
export const useUiStore = create<UiState>((set) => ({
  sidebarOpen: false,
  toggleSidebar: () => set((s) => ({ sidebarOpen: !s.sidebarOpen })),
}))

// usage — narrow selector, not the whole store:
// const open = useUiStore((s) => s.sidebarOpen)
```

### Forms + validation — React Hook Form + Zod

- Every form uses `react-hook-form` with a Zod schema via `@hookform/resolvers/zod`.
- The Zod schema is the single source of truth; infer the TS type from it with `z.infer`.
- Reuse Zod schemas to validate RTK Query request/response payloads where it adds safety.

```tsx
// src/features/<feature>/components/ExampleForm.tsx  (shared form → src/components/)
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form'
import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod'
import { z } from 'zod'

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, 'Required'),
  quantity: z.coerce.number().positive('Must be greater than 0'),
})
export type ExampleValues = z.infer<typeof schema>

export interface ExampleFormProps {
  onSubmit: (v: ExampleValues) => void
}

export function ExampleForm({ onSubmit }: ExampleFormProps) {
  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    formState: { errors },
  } = useForm<ExampleValues>({ resolver: zodResolver(schema) })

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <label htmlFor="name">Name</label>
      <input id="name" {...register('name')} />
      {errors.name && <p role="alert">{errors.name.message}</p>}

      <label htmlFor="quantity">Quantity</label>
      <input id="quantity" inputMode="numeric" {...register('quantity')} />
      {errors.quantity && <p role="alert">{errors.quantity.message}</p>}

      <button type="submit">Save</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## API contracts & mocking (fixed rules)

The API contract is a **first-class artifact**. Establish it BEFORE building the data layer or
UI, and never hand-code endpoints from memory. Record its source in `architecture.md`.

Three cases — pick based on what exists:

1. **OpenAPI / Swagger spec exists** → decide per project:
   - Clean, reasonably complete spec → **generate** the RTK Query layer with
     `@rtk-query/codegen-openapi` (typed endpoints + hooks for free). Regenerate with
     `npm run gen:api`. Don't hand-edit the generated file.
   - Partial / messy spec → hand-write the api slice (still fully typed), using the spec as
     reference.
2. **Informal contract** (Postman collection, sample JSON, a written description) → capture it
   as Zod schemas in `src/features/<domain>/schema.ts`. Those become the source of truth.
3. **Frontend-first (API not built yet)** → write the contract FIRST — Zod schemas or an
   OpenAPI stub, whichever exists (if neither, write the Zod schemas). Stand up MSW mocks from
   it and develop + test against the mock. When the real backend ships, disable mocking; if it
   honored the contract, nothing else changes.

### Mocking — MSW (default everywhere)

- MSW is the default mock layer for dev (frontend-first) **and** for component + e2e tests.
- Handlers live in `src/mocks/`, derived from the contract (Zod schemas or OpenAPI).
- Keep mock fixtures valid against the Zod schemas so the mock can't drift from the contract.

### Runtime guard

- Validate RTK Query responses with the Zod schema via `transformResponse`, so a backend that
  drifts from the agreed shape fails loudly instead of silently.

```ts
// codegen (case 1a): generated endpoints inject into the same `api` slice, then `npm run gen:api`
// openapi-config.ts
import type { ConfigFile } from '@rtk-query/codegen-openapi'
const config: ConfigFile = {
  schemaFile: './openapi.json', // or a URL to the live Swagger
  apiFile: './src/services/api.ts',
  apiImport: 'api',
  outputFile: './src/services/generatedApi.ts',
  hooks: true,
}
export default config
```

```ts
// response guard (any case): validate against the Zod schema
getItems: build.query<Item[], void>({
  query: () => 'items',
  transformResponse: (raw) => z.array(itemSchema).parse(raw),
}),
```

```ts
// mocks from the contract:  src/mocks/handlers.ts
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'
import { itemSchema } from '../features/items/schema'
import { apiBaseUrl } from '../lib/env'
const items = [itemSchema.parse({ id: '1', name: 'Example' })] // fixture must satisfy the schema
export const handlers = [http.get(`${apiBaseUrl}/items`, () => HttpResponse.json(items))]
// src/mocks/browser.ts  → setupWorker(...handlers)   (dev / frontend-first)
// src/mocks/server.ts   → setupServer(...handlers)   (tests)
```

## Testing (details in the feature-pipeline skill)

- Unit for pure logic; component tests via Testing Library (query by label/role);
  Playwright for the key flow.
- **MSW is the default mock layer** for component + e2e tests. The node server is started in
  `src/test/setup.ts` (`listen` / `resetHandlers` / `close`); for e2e, run the dev server with
  mocking enabled or hit a real backend when one exists.
- Test Zustand stores as plain functions; test Zod schemas directly for edge cases.
- Helpers in `src/test/render.tsx`: `renderWithStore(ui)` for a component, `renderRoute(path)`
  for a whole page through the router. MSW handlers use `apiBaseUrl` from `src/lib/env.ts`.
- Coverage floors live in `vitest.config.ts`. Raise them as the suite grows; never lower
  them to get green.

## Pull requests (fixed rules)

- One OpenSpec change = one PR. Max **400 reviewable lines** per PR — enforced by
  `.github/workflows/pr-size.yml` (tests, mocks, `openspec/`, lockfiles and generated code
  are excluded). Over the limit → split into smaller changes; don't grow the PR.
- Every PR fills in `.github/pull_request_template.md`, including "Review carefully" (risky
  lines + why) and "Safe to skim".
- The `large-pr-approved` label bypasses the size check. Only the human adds it.

## Definition of done (self-check ALL before stopping)

```
npm run check        # typecheck + lint + format:check + test:coverage + doctor
npm run build        # when adding dependencies or pages — enforces the bundle budget
npm run test:e2e     # when the change touches a user flow
```

The bundle budget (`CHUNK_BUDGET_KB` in `vite.config.ts`) fails the build when a JS chunk
grows too big. Fix it with lazy loading or a lighter dependency; raising it is a human call.
